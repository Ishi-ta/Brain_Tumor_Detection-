# Brain_Tumor_Detection-
This project is to analyse the tumour dataset and detect the tumour using 
k-means and allow the users to predict tumour using the algorithms. The objective is to 
achieve the pr√©cised, accurate and speedy results than the available method. The objective is 
also to understand how the algorithm will works. The main aim is to develop a software with better segmentation capability for use in medical 
imaging to detect diseases like brain tumour. Image segmentation has been identified as the key problem of medical image analysis and 
remains a popular and challenging area of research. Image segmentation is increasingly used 
in many clinical and research applications to analyse medical imaging datasets; which 
motivated us to present a snapshot of dynamically changing field of medical image 
segmentation.
